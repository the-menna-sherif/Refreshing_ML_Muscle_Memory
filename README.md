# ML, DL & AI Refresh

This repository contains a collection of **Google Colab notebooks** designed as mini-courses to help me refresh my memory and get back into practice with core concepts in:

- Machine Learning (ML)  
- Deep Learning (DL)  
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)

The goal is to rebuild intuition, sharpen skills, and stay hands-on with real code examples and exercises. It will be helpful to track progress over time & practice consistently.

## 🛠 Languages & Tools
- Python
